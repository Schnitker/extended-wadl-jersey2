        <p> This document describes the REST API and resources provided by the Person Service.         
        The REST APIs are for developers who want to integrate the Person Service into their application 
        and for administrators who want to script interactions with the Person Service.</p>
        
        <p>Because the REST API is based on open standards, you can use any web development language to access the API.</p>
